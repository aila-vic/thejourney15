The design fills the interstitial space left over by the footprint of the surrounding buildings, and is informed by their facades. The landscape architects propose a ‘topographical carpet’, spreading outwards from building edges, blurring the interface between public and private, active and passive, building and landscape. The carpet is expressed as a geometric mosaic pattern of bluestone, granite, splitstone and seasoned hardwood that successfully shifts three dimensionally to form occupiable plinths, edges and platforms, and separating circulation from carefully oriented occupiable spaces. Indigenous copses of banksia and eucalypts, under planted with native grasses, provide a drought tolerant reference to the site history as the edge of a former swamp. This project is a successful detailed addition to the pedestrian grain of the docklands precinct. ",

The result is a beautifully executed landscape which demonstrates the integral role that a landscape architect has in delivering a multi-dimensional project varying in scale, programs, stakeholders, and contexts. This project demonstrated sensitivity to social, cultural and physical contexts through an extensive consultation process with the community and various authorities. It also demonstrated the role of the landscape architect from the broad strategic scale to the detail resolution. The project focused on improved accessibility and community linkages but goes beyond a cycle routes and footpaths and creates a public space in an area that is generally forgotten. This is further developed through the use and treatment of the space under the bridge as a ‘Park.’",

This project challenged the delicate relationship between habitat and open space provision in a well-researched collaboration between landscape architects, ecologists, artists and engineers. New standards were set during the design process to further ecological and stormwater management practice. The design-led approach actively negotiates the tension between ecological systems and open space networks. The result translates complex technical requirements into high-quality design initiatives with a strong ecological underpinning. This includes the creation of habitat specifically for growling grass frogs, separate to wetlands linked to the stormwater treatment system and the open space system. A series of small scale interventions enrich the identity of the place and experience of users. This includes the abstract artwork ‘Ebb/Flow’ by artist Louise Lavarack that interprets the local hydrology. Other interventions include the secondary trail network that morph’s into a ‘kid’ scale BMX track, old bridge timbers that are reinvented as key pedestrian elements, and a truck turning-circle that houses a netball court in its spare time.

These landscape sequences are simultaneously ‘grown’ from the site and draw from the museum of curiosity; visitors are given clues as to the varied experiences that await inside the buildings through a blend of humorous elements and elegantly detailed landscape structures. Informed by a highly engaged client, Oculus’ response evokes allegory and experiment, plays with familiar forms and provides active spaces for visitor experience of the inner landscape of the Museum complex while providing views over the Derwent River and cultural landscape of outer Hobart. Their skilful use of materials and planting regimes provide tangibly artful gardens alongside dynamic public pathways that work with the topographical and management challenges that an important public institution requires. The designed landscape provides multiple experiences for visitors through a deep understanding of the spatial sequences afforded by the site and by the curatorial possibilities offered by this most unique of museums, the MONA event.

This approach is evident in the plantings and landscaping treatments throughout the campus and the careful consideration of the flow of water. The students carry out their daily school life in a respectful indigenous landscape. The school incorporates a fresh water ecology program into the curriculum, and a nature trail educates visitors of the landscape's importance.

        "description": " Australians are surrounded by ocean and ambushed from behind by desert – a war of mystery on two fronts' Lands Edge, Tim Winton. In a former sand quarry, a new botanic garden has been completed, one that allows visitors to follow a metaphorical journey of water through the Australian landscape, from the desert to the coastal fringe.Via the artistry of landscape architecture, this integrated landscape brings together horticulture, architecture, ecology, and art to create the largest botanic garden devoted to Australian flora. It seeks, through the design of themed experiences, to inspire visitors to see our plants in new ways.The completion of the Australian Garden comes at a time when Botanic Gardens world-wide are questioning existing research and recreational paradigms and refocusing anew on messages of landscape conservation and a renewed interest in meaningful visitor engagement. The Australian landscape is embraced or shunned by its people, loved for its sublime beauty or loathed as the cause of hardship. Artists and writers have often been inspired to design or write in response to subtle rhythms, flowing forms and tenacious flora of our landscape. Still others have attempted to order the landscape, and conceive of it as humanly designed form. At the Australian Garden, these tensions are the creative genesis of the design. On the east side of the garden, exhibition gardens, display landscapes, research plots and forestry arrays illustrate our propensity to frame our landscapes in more formal manners, whilst on the west, visitors are subsumed by gardens that are inspired by natural cycles, immersive landscapes and irregular floristic forms. Water plays a mediating role between these two conditions, taking visitors from rockpool escarpments, meandering riverbeds, melaleuca spits and coastal edges. Jury citation. Stage One of the Australian Garden Project in the Cranbourne Botanic Gardens had a deep impact on Botanic Gardens around the world and on our profession in Australia.The challenge of following on from this dramatic start set the bar high for Stage Two. Taylor Cullity Lethlean and Paul Thompson are to be congratulated on the success of the Australian Garden Completion. As Landscape Architects, we will undoubtedly draw inspiration from this garden for many years to come. ",

        "description": " Box Hill Gardens is a mature historical park within the urban centre of Box Hill, 14 kilometres from central Melbourne. The Box Hill Gardens Master Plan of 2011 proposed a shift in the usability of the park proposing new recreation elements and the rejuvenation of existing park spaces. This is in response to the increasing urban setting of the park and corresponding increase in workers and residents to the area. ASPECT Studios and its design team were commissioned by the City of Whitehorse to create an innovative multi-purpose space with a diverse array of recreation activities and events within the historic and well-loved Box Hill Gardens.Three key concepts have driven the design. Firstly, the creation of a contemporary recreational and events surface, that progresses from the traditional singular-use sports court. The surface functions as a flexible community space, providing courts for multiple sport and recreation activities and areas for public events.Secondly, the recycling and reinterpretation of the former tennis club house and clay courts. Part of the clubhouse has been retained and reused as seating platforms, while recycled bricks from its demolition have been utilised as feature elements within the construction of a new toilet block facility and associated brick platforms. The umpire chair and tennis roller from the previous clay courts have been salvaged and installed as playful remnants of the previous life of the site. Thirdly, the use of colour and graphics to encourage use and activity and to create a distinct surface that differentiates itself from the existing park character. A dynamic and engaging super graphic defines the play areas and creates an iconic and playful destination for the growing community.A 1km long path for walking and running will be added to the space in the near future. The path will circumnavigate the gardens, with the start and finish lines dovetailing into the multi-purpose area. The final design of the space successfully embodies a bold contemporary aesthetic with layers of history and memory, and the careful integration of landscape and built form elements.",

        "description": " Leamington Street Skate Park or 'Rezza' as it is known by the locals, is located in an out of the way section of Edwardes Lake Park, Reservoir, on an old tip site sandwiched between an ancient lawn bowls club and cracked clay tennis courts. At first glance the site appears dilapidated, with trees struggling to grow and a sea of undulating asphalt trying to hold back the rubbish and fill buried below like children's toys under a rug.Around mid-2000, Darebin Youth Services designed and implemented, with the local skater and BMX communities a small 'street style' Skate Park on the site, gleaning an old netball court in the corner. The skate park was well loved and valued by the local skaters as it provided a street style course which was seen in contrast to the popular 'bowl' skating of the time. However, the 'cherry' that really made the riders come back for more was the integration of an old-style tram barrier into the park. The bright yellow wedge-like object was unlike anything that had been considered in a skate park before and which made a direct reference to the urbane objects that street skaters appropriated in the 'everyday landscape'. It was this object and this idea of the appropriation of the everyday urban object as skate obstacle that triggered the next incarnation of the skate park. With the increase in riders using the park, so came a desire to expand the park's boundaries. Darebin Youth Services working closely with Council Landscape Architects at the time, plotted the takeover of a further two half netball courts in order to accommodate their plans for expansion. The Youth Services and council landscape architects collaborated, consulting with local youth, skaters and BMX riders to start to develop the ideas of what the extension might look like. Youth Services had a long-standing relationship working with the local skate community and had developed a strong relationship of trust.What came out of this dialogue was that everyone wanted to keep the existing aesthetic of the Rezza Skate Park- keep it rough, keep it dirty and keep it 'ghetto'. The decision to build upon the street style skate park also was a pragmatic one. The fact the site was moving and receding in particular locations due to the unstable subgrade, meant that excavation below 500mm was not possible, so this cancelled out any possibility of building a bowl or even installing large footing required for ramps.The step that followed was to find or design the objects. Youth Services had already gleaned an old steel slide that had been modified by a local steel engineer from a playground. The slide set a precedent for the design approach and confirmation that we could design a skate park from 'found'/ donated urban objects that could be modified into unique skate obstacles. Darebin then engaged Aaron Wallace from Playce to assist the next stage of the design, helping Council staff and the local skaters to develop a wish list of great skate objects and how they would be arranged on site to create a challenging and interesting skate park. Together, a wish list of items was developed, as well as a list of agencies who we thought might have these objects 'lying around'. Council landscape architects then went to work calling Victrack, Vicroads, Yarra Trams to see if they were interested donating some 'left over junk' to the skate park project. Meeting these staff and getting tours of off the track storage facilities in Niddrie and Spotswood on wintery days and having tours of under the Westgate Bridge to find bits of concrete, were all part of the job for council's landscape architects.Arranging cranes to collect the objects, working with skaters and consultants to modify objects and describing to steel engineers the importance of creating steel objects that emulate a sign pole that has been hit by a car and which sticks out at a 45 degree angle were all part of the conversations for months in preparation for the new skate park ('Yes Mick, its called a 'pole jam' and the skaters launch off it. We need it about 1 meter in length, on a 45 degree angle and it needs to be flush with the ground – it needs to look like its coming out of the ground'). Suffice to say, the project was installed with much anticipation, with local skaters breaking in over the steel site fencing every other night to ride each new obstacle as it was installed – sometimes even riding on semi- wet concrete (much to our dismay). The skate park is now complete and has become one of the hottest spots to ride in town, even attracting international pro skaters to this northern pocket of Darebin.The development of this community resource illustrates how skate parks can be used as devices to activate otherwise derelict and undervalued urban spaces. It is this setting that provides a perfect refuge for the local boys and girls to hang out, shoot hoops, and kick a ball and skate without interruption. The site has become an unintentional Youth Precinct.",

        "description": " Australia has a new National Arboretum. Located in Canberra, this important cultural facility is host to 100 forests of rare and endangered trees from around the world. This legacy project with important environmental and conservation messages will live beyond our lifetimes.The opportunity to design a play space as part of the 100 forests facility offered an opportunity to creatively engage children with the beauty of trees and we hope, foster a life-long connection to this remarkable environment. Using the idea of seeds as the beginning life amongst the forest, children and their families can enter a fantasy world of exaggerated scales. A play space with giant acorns floating in the sky, and enormous banksia cones nestled on the forest floor.The design recognises that play is a vital social development and educational tool for children of all ages, and is particularly important when it assists in forming relationships to its landscape, climate and surrounding context. The world amongst the giant seeds aims to stimulate spontaneity and creativity, to foster the imagination and to challenge and encourage confidence with growth. Within the arboretum sits a large copse of cork oaks. This copse was planted in 1917 at the instigation of Walter Burley Griffin and has been periodically harvested for cork ever since. The play space takes inspiration from this forest of oaks and has catapulted their acorns from their forest floor to land atop of a hill, somewhat larger. Here, they rest, taking on anthropomorphic qualities.A combination of Pinus macrocarpus timber battens and red cedar shingles clad a delicate steel finned fame. A clever structural solution put to TCL by Agency of Sculpture during the fabrication process. The toddler play area draws inspiration from our weird and wonderful native flora. Glass reinforced concrete Banksia seed pods rest within a sand pit with banksia seed 'lips' attached to the external forms, inviting children’s curiosity to these strange looking creatures.Here, toddlers are invited to dig, bury and make noise. Bamboo chimes, bongo drums and a thongophone animate the play structures.A large custom designed fishing net and birds nest swings provide elevated views to the broader arboretum, strategically placed adjacent to the Central Valley and in orientation to the Arboretums large sculpture entitled, 'wide brown land'. The playground aims to pursue wonder, imagination and enchantment. It was designed to encourage flexibility and spontaneity in play. The play space challenges the conventional idea of play environments and demonstrates how a play destination can not only meet stringent play standards yet offer a unique play experience for all.It is the result of a brave and trusting client and a collaborative group of designers, artisans, sculptors, fabricators, contractors and play suppliers.",

        "description": " Once a town in its own right, Dandenong has grown to be the second largest urban centre in Melbourne and one of the largest manufacturing regions in Australia. For Dandenong to service the burgeoning population of south-eastern Melbourne, its new character as a highly multicultural hub, and its role as a destination for new industry it needed to undergo intensive rejuvenation. With the centre of Dandenong in transition, Halpin Way and the adjacent public plaza of Settlers Square would be key elements in its larger urban and social transformation.With limited urbanity as context, these two public realms required a timeless design which could act as a place in its own right while devoid of built surrounds, to operate as an activator, attractor and focal public realm to assist in driving development, and act as a catalyst for new built form to be delivered into the future.As lead consultant ASPECT Studios, working collaboratively with a team of artists, architects and engineering consultants, has been involved in the full spectrum of the overall design, from the overall spatial and built form master plan of the precinct, to the design and documentation of the central street and square, lanes, public art and lighting. From the outset, this project focused on the delivery of a one of Australia's first large scale 'shared use' streets – Halpin Way – and working to develop the best shared use street configuration for a complex site,",

Wanginu Park is situated at the base of a former scoria cone volcano at Places Victoria’s Jacksons Hill Development in Sunbury. GbLA was commissioned by Places Victoria to prepare a landscape masterplan and design documentation and to oversee the preservation, rehabilitation and development of 13.54 ha of rugged landscape. The once heavily degraded site that was utilised for illegal motorcross activities and as a dumping ground for cars, fridges and other rubbish is now a major piece of passive open space that is of great value to the local community and the fauna that utilise the space. The area was set aside by Places Victoria to treat stormwater and protect valuable habitat and archaeological artifacts while meeting Places Victoria’s objectives for vegetation offset management through improvement of Plains Grassland EVC vegetation while providing for recreation and landscape amenity for the local residents of Jacksons Hill. GbLA worked with the former Ecological Engineering and Paroissien Grant and Associates to prepare a rehabilitation strategy for the heavily degraded Harpers Creek that meanders through part of the site and also for the design of a constructed stormwater wetland within difficult terrain. Highly erosive soils, steep terrain up to 1:1 grades, sheer cliff faces and recorded archaeological sites within the project area further added to the challenges of achieving vegetation offset targets, pedestrian access, water quality harvesting and management requirements. The vegetation management and improvement regimes included fencing to exclude grazing, rabbit control programs promoting natural regeneration of the native seed bank, mosaic burning, mulching of extensive areas of woody weeds to provide cover to the existing seed bank, planting of over 200,000 plants, direct seeding 340,000 grass species and ongoing monitoring of the performance of the vegetation. Pedestrian trails, picnic areas and interpretive signage all help to the local community to interact with and appreciate the landscape and historic cultural significance of the site and the local area. The development of a passive circulation trail and interpretive signage strategy, seating and picnic facilities has helped local residents engage with the space and to engender a sense of ownership of a once highly degraded landscape.The rehabilitated landscape also provided new habitat opportunities for local wombats, kangaroos, frogs and bird life, including a wedge tailed eagle that resides in the local area.",

        "description": " The design of the Strathewen Bushfire memorial was a collaboration between Urban Initiatives and Arterial Design. The intent of the memorial was to capture the many and varied effects of the 2009 Black Saturday Bushfires on Strathewen residents, as well as the surrounding environment. It was to be a place that acknowledged individuals who lost their lives in the fire, as well as telling the story of camaraderie and strength in rebuilding the community after the fires. The challenge was to take visitors on a journey of before, during and after the fire, without them reliving the horror of the event. It was to capture the gravity of the day and the ripple effects on the community, but to be sombre and respectful in its treatment. The memorial sits in a peaceful and tucked away section of public reserve near the recreation reserve which was the central gathering point for the community immediately after the fires. It was designed to fit within the bushland setting with seating for quiet contemplation and reflection. The local provenance planting and materials for the memorial were selected to ensure the memorial has a resonance and timeless quality, which sit firmly within the space and ground on which it is set. The memorial was designed to tell the story to future generations. Constructed from sandstone and slate with concrete and timber seating, the materials were chosen to weather well over time and endure a lifespan of up to 100 years. The design brief was the result of extensive community engagement and from the start of our involvement and collaboration, the community ensured a strong ownership of the project. They were open to the process of telling their stories and we made the commitment to them that every voice would be represented. Arterial worked with the concept of haiku poetry to weave the varying intensities of people’s words into a journey of diverse experiences- heat, wind and fire, loss, grief, rebuilding, joy and friendship. The haiku verses were sandblasted at varying depths into sandstone that become more legible via the shadows that they cast. The juxtaposition of content allows the reader to grab moments of highs and lows without becoming overwhelmed with the enormity of the event. The community expressed a wish for a water element as a symbol of cleansing the soul and nourishing new growth. This inspired the simple concept of water drops in the landscape. Water drops of course create ripples of concentric circles. Circles have no beginning and no end. They represent the cycle of life and of healing. As we got to know the community and they told us their stories, we began to reference the water drops as teardrops. And so developed a simple concept of four tear drops in the landscape radiating ripples out into the surrounding environment. These were carefully sited with a natural cleared area close to, but sufficiently separate from, the recreation reserve. Across 400 pieces of circular sandstone cut to varying radii, there are a total of 10,000 words set within the ground plane. These are arranged within the four circles thereby telling the collective community storey of Strathewen. The memorial is a seamless integration of story and context.The approach path to the memorial contains a ring that references stories of Strathewen before the fire, while moving over the bridge and stream the main central circle tells the story and tragedy of the event. The intensity is focused on the central droplet which is surrounded by a circular bench seat. Embedded within the paving are the names and ages of the 29 community members who perished. Text bands carry stories of broader losses on the outer edge of the central ring and more personal acknowledgements closer to the centre. The visitor journey intensifies toward the centre of the main circle. Brief poems and short memories begin to acknowledge the names of loved ones. In the centre of the main circle lay 29 stainless steel plaques, (surrounding a reflective stainless steel dome), each carrying the name and age of a community member who died in the fires. Amongst those names is Jacinta Bartlett (landscape architect, colleague and former client), her husband Garry and 6 year old daughter Erryn. There is a circular seat defining the inner circle thereby embracing the sacred nature of this central space. The third ring contains messages of thanks for the support that the community received during and after the fire, while the final ring focuses on the future and stories of renewal and recovery. The combination is a very moving and powerful interplay of landscape, story and experience.",

The space could have easily been dominated by the neo brutalist architecture of the Lyons-designed Dandenong Civic Centre and Library adjacent, however the fine grain of its paving design and splashes of intense colour give the square a strong presence that is at once warm and welcoming. The paving motif, done in collaboration with Material Thinking, was created from fabric patterns found around Dandenong and enriches the design with cultural narrative and meaning. In the centre of the square a grid of mature araucarias provide definition and intimacy, and a large public screen ensures a constant sense of activity.
