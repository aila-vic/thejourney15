The landscape architects propose a ‘topographical carpet’, spreading outwards from building edges, blurring the interface between public and private, active and passive, building and landscape. ",

The Toomuc Creek wetland, shared trail, playground and artwork employs a new approach to constructed ecology, drainage infrastructure, recreation and place making. At the centre of the reserve is an experiential sculpture, ‘Ebb/Flow’ by Louise Lavarack. The artwork inteprets the interface between the land and the sky as well as the seasonal changes in the local climate. A further feature of the project is the construction of breeding ponds for the growling grass frogs. The ponds separate from the wetland that will be periodically filled to match the frog breeding cycles but also drained to prevent populations of predatory fish establishing.",

The new trail traverses the river through steep and challenging terrain, setting up dramatic spatial sequences that better connect people to this landscape.

This approach is evident in the plantings and landscaping treatments throughout the campus and the careful consideration of the flow of water. The students carry out their daily school life in a respectful indigenous landscape. The school incorporates a fresh water ecology program into the curriculum, and a nature trail educates visitors of the landscape's importance. In other parts of the campus are productive gardens and a nursery. The project is a model for an 'environmental education in school landscapes'.",

This project completed under the Revitalising Central Dandenong urban renewal initiative offers a public square that is truly civic in nature, providing for gatherings, events, diversity, arts and culture. The space could have easily been dominated by the neo brutalist architecture of the Lyons-designed Dandenong Civic Centre and Library adjacent, however the fine grain of its paving design and splashes of intense colour give the square a strong presence that is at once warm and welcoming. The paving motif, done in collaboration with Material Thinking, was created from fabric patterns found around Dandenong and enriches the design with cultural narrative and meaning. In the centre of the square a grid of mature araucarias provide definition and intimacy, and a large public screen ensures a constant sense of activity. The project also provides the missing link in the pedestrian spine connecting Lonsdale Street and Dandenong Station via Halpin Way and Settlers Square. ",

At the same time the exhibit had to approximate a specific natural habitat and provide a compelling visitor experience.\nThe exhibit reflects a new approach in zoological design, one that merges design, engineering and constructed ecology. The water in the three Hippo ponds is filtered through the wetland system to remove suspended solids, trap and remove organisms and decrease overall nutrient levels. The system’s total capacity is approximately 4.5 million litres.\n",
